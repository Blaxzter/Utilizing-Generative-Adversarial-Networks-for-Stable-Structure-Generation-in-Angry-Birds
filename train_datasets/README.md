# Datasets

This folder contains the original generated levels with the level generator IratusAves by Matthew Stephenson.  
These are the datasets used to train the GAN's.  

As described in the paper, i filtered the data based on a few kriteria.

The filter function create_filtered_dataset was used for that: [FilterDataSet](../src/data_scripts/FilterDataSet.py)
